## First download the project to your computer/laptop and open it using either pycharm or VS Code, I'll explain using Pycharm Community Edition
## Open the terminal on Pycharm and run the project using the following command
## python manage.py runserver

## NB: BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING DEPENDENCIES INSTALLED, IF NOT, USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS TO INSTALL THEM
             pip install django
             pip install requests
             pip install Pillow  
## After running the project on the terminal, this should be displayed on the browser.

## You can choose to create you own superuser on the terminal by using this command
          ## python manage.py createsuperuser
    ## You will then be prompted to enter the username, email, and password.


     or you can use my login credentials, though it is not advisable:
     username: fatmahussein 
     pasword: fatmahussein

## Now, run the project and go to the browser and type this    
             ##  http://127.0.0.1:8000/                and this will be displayed

## And on another tab type this
             ##  http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin        and this will be displayed

## And now you can login both on the frontend side and backend side using you credentials or mine.
